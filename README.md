# Face-recognition-based-attendance-system
This project proposes facial recognition systems using OpenCV. The system is capable of matching  a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed  to authenticate users through ID verification services.
Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library.

Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!
